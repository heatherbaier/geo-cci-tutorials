# geo-cci-tutorials
Tutorials for the GEO CCI project team

### Pytorch Tutorials
1) pytorch_tutorial.ipynb: This will walk you through how to train a ResNet18 on the Mexico schools imagery and saved the trained weights to a .torch file
2) pytorch_transfer_learning.ipynb: This next tuorial will walk you through how to load in the trained weights from the Mexico dataset and use those as a starting point to continue training on the Philippines dataset.
3) pytorch_eval.ipynb: This will walk you through how to evaluate the trained Mexico & Philippines model on the Brazil dataset.
4) pytorch_weights_matrices.ipynb: This tutoiral is not required in any way, however it will briefly walk you through what is actually inside of the .torch files you're saving and explain what the weight matrices are and how they connect with the models you are training.


### TensorFlow Tutorials
1) tensorflow_tutorial.ipynb: This will walk you through how to train a ResNet18 on the Mexico schools imagery and saved the trained weights to a .ckpt file
2) tensorflow_transfer_learning.ipynb: This next tuorial will walk you through how to load in the trained weights from the Mexico dataset and use those as a starting point to continue training on the Philippines dataset.
3) tensorflow_eval.ipynb: This will walk you through how to evaluate the trained Mexico & Philippines model on the Brazil dataset.
